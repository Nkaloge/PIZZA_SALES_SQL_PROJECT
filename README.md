In this project, I used SQL to analyze a pizza sales dataset and deliver key business insights. The analysis includes:

📦 Total orders, revenue, and top-performing pizzas

🍕 Most popular pizza sizes and categories

⏱️ Order patterns by time and date

💰 Revenue breakdown and top earners by type and category

📊 Cumulative and percentage-based revenue analysis

This end-to-end SQL project demonstrates my ability to clean, join, aggregate, and extract actionable insights from real-world data—supporting smarter decisions in the food retail domain.
